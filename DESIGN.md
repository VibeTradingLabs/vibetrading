Positioning: Agent-First, Prompt-to-Strategy, Developer-Friendly

1. Product Positioning
Core Identity

VibeTrading is an open-source trading framework where users describe strategies in natural language and AI agents generate, backtest, and deploy executable code across exchanges.

It is:

Agent-first — natural language is the primary interface for strategy creation

Prompt-to-strategy — structured AI pipeline from idea to running code

Backtest-native — generated strategies run in backtesting and live trading with identical code

Exchange-agnostic — one strategy runs on Hyperliquid, Paradex, Lighter, and more

Framework-complete — full lifecycle from generation to deployment

It is not:

A SaaS platform

A signal-selling product

A no-code builder (strategies are real Python, not visual blocks)

A black-box trading bot

2. Website Philosophy
Guiding Principles

Lead with the prompt-to-strategy workflow — show that users describe what they want and get running code.

Make the AI generation pipeline visible and concrete — not a vague "AI-powered" claim.

Show the full lifecycle: prompt → code → backtest → deploy.

Provide runnable examples immediately.

Move architecture details to Docs and Concepts pages.

Section 2 — How It Works (Primary Section)

Three-step workflow:

1. Describe

Tell the agent what you want in natural language.

"RSI(14) oversold entry, ATR-based stop loss, 3x leverage on BTC"

2. Generate

The AI agent produces framework-compatible strategy code with the @vibe decorator, proper risk management, and exchange-agnostic execution.

3. Backtest & Deploy

Run the generated code against historical data. When ready, deploy to a live exchange with zero code changes.

Section 3 — Quick Example (Critical Section)

Show the end-to-end workflow:

```python
from vibetrading import BacktestEngine

# Strategy generated from prompt:
# "BTC momentum with SMA crossover, 3x leverage, 10% position size"
strategy_code = """
import vibetrading

@vibetrading.vibe
def momentum_strategy():
    price = vibetrading.get_price("BTC")
    balance = vibetrading.my_futures_balance("USDC")

    df = vibetrading.get_futures_ohlcv("BTC", "1h", 50)
    if len(df) < 20:
        return

    df["sma_fast"] = df["close"].rolling(10).mean()
    df["sma_slow"] = df["close"].rolling(20).mean()

    position = vibetrading.get_futures_position("BTC")
    vibetrading.set_leverage("BTC", 3)

    if df["sma_fast"].iloc[-1] > df["sma_slow"].iloc[-1] and position <= 0:
        qty = (balance * 0.1) / price
        vibetrading.long("BTC", qty, price, order_type="market")
    elif df["sma_fast"].iloc[-1] < df["sma_slow"].iloc[-1] and position > 0:
        vibetrading.reduce_position("BTC", abs(position))
"""

engine = BacktestEngine(
    start_time=datetime(2025, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    end_time=datetime(2025, 6, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    interval="1h",
    exchange="hyperliquid",
    initial_balances={"USDC": 10000},
)
results = engine.run(strategy_code)
```

The example should demonstrate:

Strategy code generated from a human-readable prompt

Unified engine usage

Backtest-native workflow

Keep it short and readable.

Section 4 — Why Agent-First

Three blocks:

1. Structured Interface for LLMs

The @vibe decorator and vibetrading namespace create a deterministic, well-constrained API surface that LLMs can target reliably. Every function, parameter, and return type is designed for machine generation.

2. Generate → Validate → Iterate

Generated strategies can be immediately backtested. Errors are captured with full context (line number, code snippet) and fed back to the LLM for automatic correction. This enables closed-loop strategy refinement.

3. Same Code Everywhere

Strategies generated by AI run identically in backtesting and live trading. No translation layer. No manual adaptation. The agent writes it once and it works across environments and exchanges.

Section 5 — Core Capabilities

Four blocks:

1. Strategy Generation

Generate structured trading strategies from natural language prompts. Output is framework-compatible, execution-ready, and backtest-ready. Any LLM can target the vibetrading API.

2. Multi-Exchange Support

Deploy the same strategy across different exchanges. Exchange logic is abstracted through adapters. Write once. Run anywhere.

3. Built-in Backtesting

Backtest strategies using the same code used for live trading. No separate implementation required. Full metrics: Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate, funding revenue.

4. Agent Skill Exposure

Expose the framework as a skill for autonomous agent systems. The @vibe interface, structured error handling, and metadata models make VibeTrading a composable building block for agent pipelines.

7. Messaging Guidelines
Tone

Clear

Technical

Direct

Confident but not hyped

Agent-native vocabulary

Prefer

"Describe your strategy" over "Write your strategy"

"Generate" over "Create" (when referring to AI output)

"Prompt-to-strategy" over "AI-powered"

"Agent skill" over "AI feature"

Avoid

"Revolutionary"

"AI-powered future"

"Autonomous wealth engine"

"Next generation quant"

"No-code" (strategies ARE code — they are generated code)

Use

Framework

Strategy

Prompt

Generate

Backtest

Agent

Skill

Deploy

8. Agent Positioning Strategy

Important:

On homepage:

Agent-first is the core identity. The primary workflow is prompt-to-strategy.

In documentation:

Agent integration is an architectural layer with detailed guidance on prompt templates, constraint schemas, error feedback loops, and tool integration.

For developers:

The framework is equally usable without AI. Manual strategy writing is fully supported. The agent-first positioning reflects the primary use case, not a requirement.

This preserves:

Agent-first identity as the primary value proposition

Developer accessibility for those who prefer manual coding

Ecosystem flexibility for integration with any LLM or agent framework

9. Long-Term Scalability Consideration

The website should allow expansion without repositioning:

Future additions:

Multi-agent strategy orchestration

Evolutionary strategy optimization (genetic/tournament-based)

RL-based strategy refinement

Strategy marketplace

Performance evaluation and ranking framework

Cross-exchange arbitrage pipelines

None of these should require changing homepage positioning. The agent-first framing naturally accommodates all of them.

10. Visual Style Guidelines

Design Direction:

Clean

White or dark minimal

Developer-first

Monospace code emphasis

No excessive animation

Workflow-oriented (show the prompt → code → result pipeline visually)

Inspirations:

Cursor

Vercel

LangChain

FastAPI

Code blocks should visually dominate over marketing graphics.

The prompt-to-strategy flow (input prompt → generated code → backtest results) should be the visual centerpiece of the homepage.

11. Summary

VibeTrading.dev website should:

Present a clear agent-first framework identity

Lead with the prompt-to-strategy workflow

Show the full lifecycle: describe → generate → backtest → deploy

Provide runnable examples immediately

Demonstrate that generated strategies are real, executable Python

Move implementation depth into documentation

Core Homepage Message:

VibeTrading is an open-source framework where you describe trading strategies in natural language and AI generates executable code that backtests and deploys across exchanges.

Everything else is detail.
